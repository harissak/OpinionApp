# Opinion project

OPINION PROJECT is my own project where I wanted to broaden my knowledge in Angular. 
Idea was to create app where person can easily register him self (it is needed just username and password) and after to log in and give his own opinion obout 
someone or even something. To give opinion you have to be registered user. It is possible to change your password, to delete opinions that you wrote.
Everyone can filter opinions by profile (registered person who wrote opinion) and see all opinions from one person or filter by "about who" opinion is writen. Also,
it is possible to search "about who". There is also possibility to see statistical data like how many registered users are ther, hom many comments is writen and also
to see how many time each persone were commented.

During this project I used:
- Angular and typescript (javascript also)
- Routing
- Pipe (one pipe created by myself)
- Arrays
- Maps
- Services
- Subjects and EventEmiters
- Template driven and Reactive forms
